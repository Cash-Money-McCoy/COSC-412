Standards


* Code needs to be formatted and must fit on screen
* Code variables need to make sense and not be random
* Comments must be throughout the code explaining what is going on
   * No single line comments saying “It works”
* Written config values should be at the top of methods
* Try to reuse code, if you write it more than once it’s probably inefficient


Maintainability


* Bugs within the code should be commented at the top of the method / file
* Code should be easily reusable and modular


Performance


* Javascript files should be minimized on the site to speed up load times
* Picture files should be minimized with the highest quality to a 1600x900 resolution, we don’t need to load 9000x9000 high quality images that may crash client browsers
* Data be persisted on the client to keep load time low


Architecture


* Javascript should be put into files that are loaded in HTML, try to keep <script> tags in html to a minimum
* Tab your code, no one likes it when it’s hard to read
